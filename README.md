Summary of Analysis
School Performance Overview:

During our analysis, we looked at various measures to understand how well schools were doing. We considered things like how well students did in math and reading, the percentage of students passing these subjects, and how many students passed overall. To make sense of the data, we grouped schools based on their size, how much they spent on each student, and whether they were charter or district schools.

Impact of School Size on Performance:

We categorized schools into small, medium, and large based on their total number of students.
On average, smaller schools (with fewer than 1,000 students) tend to perform better in both math and reading compared to medium and large schools.
Smaller schools also display higher passing rates in math, reading, and overall compared to their larger counterparts.

Effect of Per Student Budget on Performance:

Schools were categorized into spending ranges per student, such as <$585, $585-630, $630-645, and $645-680.
Schools with lower per student budgets tend to achieve higher average scores in both math and reading, as well as higher passing rates.

Conclusions
School Size and Performance:

Smaller schools appear to have an advantage in terms of student performance. They tend to achieve higher average scores and passing rates, which might be attributed to more focused attention on individual students.
Budget Impact on Academic Achievement:

Lower per student budgets are associated with higher academic performance. This could suggest that efficient allocation of resources directly contributes to improved student outcomes.
